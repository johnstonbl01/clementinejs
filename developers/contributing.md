### Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute:

- **Filing an Issue** - if you find a bug or want to request an enhancement, [file an issue](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs/issues/new).
- **Working on Issues** - feel free to pick up [any open issue](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs/issues) that you feel you're capable of addressing.
- **Documentation** - if you enjoy writing and want to contribute to the project, try improving [our documentation](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs/tree/gh-pages).

#### Filing an Issue

[Issues should be filed](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs/issues/new) directly inside of the GitHub repository. File an issue if:

- You've identified a bug in the application. This means that you believe something is working incorreclty and should be fixed.
- You want to request a new feature for the application. This means that you believe something is missing and should be included.

For bug reports, please include:

- A description of the actions taken when the error or bug was found.
- What you expected the behavior to be when taking this action.
- What actually happened when this action was taken.
- If you have any interest in addressing the issue yourself.

For feature requests, please include:

- A description of the problem you want to solve.
- Your opinion on the best solution for this problem.
- If you have any interest in addressing the issue yourself.

Please include as much detail as possible to help the team address your issue. If you have a question, please feel free to reach out to any of the [team members](#current-team).

#### Working on Issues

Please feel free to begin working on any open issue in the [issue list](https://github.com/johnstonbl01/clementinejs/issues) of the GitHub repository. If the issue is still open, that means that the team plans on eventually addressing it, and any help is appreciated. Please consider:

- **Beginner issues** - If you've never contributed to the project, you may want to try one of the issues tagged with `beginner`. These issues are small and self-contained and provide good experience for new contributors.
- **Accepted issues** - Issues tagged with `accepted` will eventually be addressed by the team. Please only submit requests for accepted issues.

If you're going to work on an issue, please add a comment to that issue saying so and indicating when you think you'll be able to complete it. This helps to avoid any duplicate effort.

Examples:

- "I'll take a look at this issue over the weekend."
- "I'm going to work on this. Give me two weeks to complete it."
- "I'm looking into this and should have something in a couple days."

If someone has already committed to work on an issue, please do not work on it. If you're unable to finish work on an issue, please add a comment letting people know. Don't worry if this is the case, we appreciate all contributions. 

If the issue significantly changes an existing feature / function of the application, it's required that documentation is also updated.

#### Documentation

There are several ways to help with documentation, including:

- Fixing typos
- Improving the existing documentation (i.e. making it more clear or concise)
- Add new documentation for features that were missed or overlooked.
